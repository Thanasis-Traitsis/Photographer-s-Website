# Photographers-Website

This is my latest project, I designed and developed a four-page website for a photographer / graphic designer. Like any other project, I was focused on the key characteristics of my client, which led me to create a unique website that stands out. As a result, the website helped introduce the great work of the photographer to more people. 

This is a fully responsive one page website. The design was premade and my job was to build it from scratch.
